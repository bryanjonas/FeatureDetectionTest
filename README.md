# FeatureDetectionTest

This is a test of the Mask_RCNN implementation for Keras from [Matterport](https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN).  The general structure of the python notebook was taken from [Immersive Limit](https://github.com/akTwelve/tutorials/blob/master/mask_rcnn/MaskRCNN_TrainAndInference.ipynb).
